#### From Jalna to Nanded

While I was on the way from Jalna to Nanded, I had telephoned three taluka level groups and met then on the way. The talukas are Patlur, Selur and Purna. All of them fall in the Parbhani constituency. I was very touched and motivated by seeing the energy at these talukas.

I told the workers not to expect anything form the candidate and run their own campaigns by appointing booth level workers and doing door to door campaigning. I told them not to even expect a visit from the candidate. All of them told me that they are already campaigning in full swing. They are all doing the work and printing their own pamphlets without any expectation or support.

The party's message has got a very strong undercurrent in the interior talukas. These workers are taking ownership of the campaign and doing personal sacrifices. This is a good indication for AAP and the country.

#### Latur

For example in Ahmedpur Taluka, the team has prepared a schedule till the 15th and identified which village to focus which day based on the market day. They have also setup booth level management and are arranging their own finance. They seem like a very politically aware team.

Another good example is that of Syed village in Nilanga Taluka. Majority of the people of this village belong to a Syed family. They have 150 houses in the village and all major village positions are held by this family. The family has a jaggery factory which they have closed for the campaign and all of them are fully into the campaigning for the party. Some of the young and educated youth have also left their jobs and are campaigning for the party. This is very encouraging.
