title: Media Must Introspect on Paid News
---
Recently Aam Aadmi Party leader, Arvind Kejriwal had said that he wanted to investigate the media for biased reporing, and if any media houses were found guilty of publishing paid news, then they must be send to jail. This is exactly what the Indian law says, so it should not be taken as a wild statement. The media on the other hand took it personally and made it into a big issue, saying that he did not have any proof.

There are so many instances of paid news, that if the media was honest, they need not have looked far.

In the Last Vidhan Sabha elections in Maharahtra, Ashok Chavan had sponsored a supplement called "Ashok Parva". In this, he had compared himeself to King Ashok and it was full of praise for him. There was no indication in the newspaper that it was a paid supplement. Noted Journalist P. Sainath had filed a complaint to the election commission and press council and it is still pending.

Last time when I stood for election as an independant candidate for Vidhan Sabha, a lot of newspapers contacted me with special "packages". They had packages for front-page, inner pages. They said, they could run articles for as many days as long as I paid. The article would be worded exactly what I want. Election is a special earning season for certain media houses. My complaint is still pending with the election commission and press council.

The reporters who wrote columns on the issues I was involved in, suddenly found that they cannot write about my story. The could not even write a story about me that was not related to the election. The editor simply said that this is the decision of the newspaper owner.

It is the duty of the newspapers to report with full honesty to the people. This is a duty in which certain news houses today are terribly failing. In a reaction to this, I decided to start my own paper, [Janata Ka Aaina](http://aainanews.blogspot.com) to provide impartial news for the people.

It is time the media turns its eyes on its own mess and cleans it up. By accusing Kejriwal of attacking the media, they are only delaying the problem.
