Wherever I have travelled, I have found that people have a great love and respect for the Aam Aadmi Topi.

#### Topi Ki Upar Uthao (Raise the Cap)

Once during my travels, I was riding pillion on a motorcycle with my Aam Aadmi Topi on. The wind was flying on my face and the topi flew away. I looked behind and it seemed that a labourer had caught it. He was running towards us. He seemed a poor landless labourer but had a spark in his eyes. With great care the put the topi back on my head and said,

*"Topi ko neeche nahi girne do, isko toh upar uthana hain!" (Don't let the cap fall, we have to raise it much higher)*

#### Chasing Us Down

Later we were driving in a car going to Nanded with party workers. All of us were wearing our Aam Aadmi Caps. An ST Bus driver was coming fast from behind. Bus drivers in rural India drive as if they own the roads. All of us thought he was a rash driver and he wanted to overtake us. So I told the driver to slow down and let him go.

But as soon as he lined up beside us, he honked and had a big smile on his face. He wanted to show his support for Aam Aadmi Party!

#### Don't Give Me A Bribe

Later we reached Nanded town and the driver was new, so he may have parked in a wrong place. Soon a police havaldar came to him and told him that he has made a mistake by parking here. The only way out he suggested was that he give him a bribe of Rs 250.

The driver was thinking what to do and suddenly the havaldar's eye caught the Aam Aadmi Topi in the drivers seat. He asked the driver, whether he belongs to Aam Aadmi Party. The driver said yes.

In that case, the havaldar said, I don't want a bribe!
