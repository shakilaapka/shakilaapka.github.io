title: What Rahul Gandhi Needs To Know About Kolis of Mumbai
---
The scion of the Congress Party, Rahul Gandhi, visited the Kolis (fisherfolk) of Mumbai city today to sit with them and understand their problems. The Kolis are one of the original inhabitants of this island city and at the end of a ten-year rule of his party in the Center, Rahul Gandhi wants to know and understand their problem.

Never mind the fact that it took the Congress Party 10 years of being in power to find time to ask the Kolis about their problems. Never mind that instead of understanding their problems, he should be asking about what has his government done for the Kolis. What Rahul Gandhi does not understand is that the problems are created by the policies created by his own governments, not the people. The people would be happier living as they did without the government policies towards their land and occupation.

In the years of Congress rule, let us see what has happened of the Kolis

1. All their spaces are gone away. The open spaces where they dried their fish. The grounds where they proudly held cultural events, the gaonthans. Its all gone to the builders. In the name of Slum Rehabilitation, the entire fabric of the community has been destroyed. Koliwadas of Mumbai are eaten away by the builders.
2. New wealth in Mumbai has multiplied many fold over the past few decades. How much of this has gone to the Kolis? What kind of facilities, opportunities have been created? Why are the Kolis left behind?
3. The Governmenet cares only about the fisherfolk when there is a big storm and many of them go missing. There has been no systematic process to understand their problems. The politicians who rule Mumbai come from the hinterland and have no understanding of the problem of the fisherfolk. There are no safety rules, infrastructure, no group insurance for the Kolis.

The Chief Minister, Prithviraj Chavan told the Kolis that the Animal Husbandary Department has marked Rs 1600 crore for the Kolis. One Koli replied that the department only understands the problems of the farmers. The issues of the Kolis are very different.

In the end, Rahul Gandhi would have driven away on the smooth and magestic Rajiv Gandhi - Bandra Worli Sealink, built on the land that once belonged to the Kolis, and is now used to ease the movement of car owners who make less than a fraction of the population of the Kolis.
