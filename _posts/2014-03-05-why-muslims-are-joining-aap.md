title: Muslims Joining Aam Aadmi Party in Large Numbers
---
Muslims are coming to Aam Aadmi Party in large numbers. I must have attended hundereds of public meetings in rural and urban Mahashtra and the feeling is unmistakable. Muslims usually form 10%-15% of the local populations, but their presence in AAP meetings is much larger than this. In many meetings I find that more than half of the audience is Muslim. This is a trend I have seen everywhere. There are many interesting observations here.

#### Not For My Religion

These Muslims have not come because some religious leaders is asking them to come. Infact in none of the meetings, I have heard them ask questions about their religion or expect the party to give them special benefits. Their problems are exactly the same as that of every other Aam Aadmi. They want jobs, housing and basic amenities for themselves. They feel that the party that can deliver that is the Aam Aadmi Party.

The only talk I get of religious issues, is from the people who aspire to be leaders.

#### Congress Mukti

For years, the Muslims have India have remained trapped in the Congress Party. A well known commentator recently told me that in his experience, apart from the Congress, there have been only two national leaders that have appealed to the Muslims in such large numbers. One was V. P. Singh and the other is Arvind Kejriwal.

Muslims are ready for progressive leadership and they see Aam Aadmi Party as a vehicle to deliver that.

#### Because We Are Indians

Most other parties view Muslims as minorities and treat them as vote banks. But the Aam Aadmi Party treats them as equal citizens, just like any other Aam Aadmi. The problems of the Aam Muslim are same as the Aam Aadmi.

Another reason, why Aam Aadmi Party may spring a surprise this summer.
