During the elections, everyone is an expert.

Once on the trail, I halted to have a cup of tea at a roadside joint in the interiors. Seeing my AAP cap, a villager walked up to me.

"When is Arvind Kejriwal coming to meet us?" he asked me. He said, he has heard all Arvind's speeches and thinks that the country really needs a leader like him. He is very happy with the party but there is only one problem. "He should not have quit Delhi government. If he had been patient, it would have been a lot better.", he tells me.

I was surprised with the level of awareness that exists in the interiors of Maharashtra for the Aam Aadmi Party. The political message has certainly spread far and wide.

Finally, he did not let me pay for the tea.
