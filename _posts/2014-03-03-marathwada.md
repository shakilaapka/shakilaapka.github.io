For the past one year, I have been devoting most of my time for the Aam Aadmi Party. As a social activist for the past 20 years, I realized, along with many others, that real change can only come from politics. When the Aam Aadmi Party was formed, I was one of the first few social activists to join it. Since then, I have been a part of the Maharashtra State Executive and also a member of the Social Justice Committee. I have met hundreds of very enthusasitc people from all walks of life and it has been a great experience.

Politics is still a black hole for most people and through this blog, I wish to share my experiences with the inner working of politics for the common-man. The objective is to open up political decision making for the common person, the Aam Aadmi.

#### Marathwada

Over the last few months, I have been given the responsibility of overseeing the Marathwada Region. The center of Marathwada is Aurangabad and consists of Beed, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad, Hingoli and Jalna Districts. This is one of the most backward regions in the state and is ignored by all political parties.
