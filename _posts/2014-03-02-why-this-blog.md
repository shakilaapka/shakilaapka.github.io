title: Why This Blog
---
For the past one year, I have been devoting most of my time for the Aam Aadmi Party. As a social activist for the past 20 years, I realized, along with many others, that real change can only come from politics. When the Aam Aadmi Party was formed, I was one of the first few social activists to join it. Since then, I have been a part of the Maharashtra State Executive and also a member of the Social Justice Committee. I have met hundreds of very enthusasitc people from all walks of life and it has been a great experience.

Politics is still a black hole for most people and through this blog, I wish to share my experiences with the inner working of politics for the common-man. The objective is to open up political decision making for the common person, the Aam Aadmi.
