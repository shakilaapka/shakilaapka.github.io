title: Maharashtra Navnirmaan (re-development) Sena (army) is a Wasted Opportunity
---
Eight years ago, when Raj Thackeray split from his cousin and started a new party, he called it Maharahstra Navnirmaan Sena (MNS), the army for Maharashtra's Redevelopment. But one needs to seriously ask, what development has the MNS has for Maharshtra? The MNS was blessed with popular support and money power, but it seems they have wasted their opportunity.

Today Maharshtrian culture is on the decline, the state infrastructure is crumbling, builders are ruling, the interiors are still poor are dry and farmers are committing suicide.

Today MNS wants you to vote for them and defeat the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, so that they can support BJP Prime Ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi. What kind of Navnirmaan is this?
