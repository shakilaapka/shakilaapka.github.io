title: Politics of Give and Take

Over the last few months, I have been given the responsibility of overseeing the Marathwada Region. The center of Marathwada is Aurangabad and consists of Beed, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad, Hingoli, Parbhani and Jalna Districts. This is one of the most backward regions in the state and is ignored by all political parties.

## Munde's Politics

Each of the districts in Marathwada has their overlords. The lord of Beed district is the senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde. Beed is one of the least backward districts in the country. Gopinath Munde has been the former deputy CM of Maharashtra and yet this is the state of his district.

On my travels to Beed, I found out how this happens.

All political parties have a pact that their top leaders must be elected. To ensure this, parties will ensure that from wherever a big leaders contests for elections, other parties will put up weak candidates. This is true for almost everywhere in Maharashtra.

I Beed district, NCP is the other party that has a presennce. The pact between Munde and NCP is this:

1. NCP will let Munde win Lok Sabha (National Election) from Beed. They will put up weak candidate and create an atmosphere where NCP workers will fall at the feet of Munde when he is in the district. (Yes, even today, in rural India, the people are expected to demonstrate their love for the politicians by falling at their feet.)
1. In Vidhan Sabha (State Elections), Munde's daughter is sure to win too.
1. In return of this favour, NCP will win 5 of the other 6 seats in Beed.

This is how politicans win in rural area and this is what Aam Aadmi Party will change. We will give these politicans who are not used to fight elections in their home districts a run for their money. The people have remained quiet for a long time because the were denied any alternative.

This is the reason Aam Aadmi Party might do better than people think, in rural India.
