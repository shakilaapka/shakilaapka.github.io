title: Notes from Latur
---
*From the campaign trail*. I stayed the night with the secratary of the Latur District. He has a 50 acre plot and has built for himself a nice haveli in which he welcomed me. He is also very fond of dogs and proudly showed me trophies that his dogs had won.

#### "There is a lot of profit in agriculture"

In his 50 acre plot, he grows 25 acre sugarcane and various other crops like chana, moong, chickoo in the other 25 acre. "Who says there is no money in agriculture" he tells me. He says agriculture is very profitable. As soon as the sugar canes start standing up in the field, he already enters into a contract with the sugar mill owners, they pay him in advance just by seeing his standing crop. For the cutting, banjara (tribal) couples come and stay in the field for as little as Rs 200 per day. These days, the cutting is also managed by the sugar mills.

Marathwada is a dry region, so I asked him from where does he get the water? He said that he has bought a small plot of land next to a dam and there is always water in that plot. He has dug a big well in that plot and transports water to his sugarcane plot.

He used to own a small jaggery unit too. But the profit from sugarcane is so good that he has shut down his unit.

#### Plight of Small Farmers

I asked him about the fields next to him which seemed empty. He said that small farmers can only grow vegetables because they do not have holding capacity. They need to turn over their capital soon enough. The vegitable market is also very volatile. Vengetables that go for Rs 10 per kg, can go upto 50p per kg as soon as they start perishing. The life of small farmers is very difficult.

#### The Next Generation

His son is well educated and has a BA degree. I asked him what will he do? Our secretary said that he will join me at the farm!

I was wondering how did he from such a rural area join the Aam Aadmi Party? Facebook, he said.
