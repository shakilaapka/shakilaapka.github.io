<p class="lead">With a degree in law, Shakil has fought several important cases of human rights abuses, and has worked for the implementation of the Srikrishna Commission and Gundewar Commission. He has traveled across the country on fact-finding committees set up to probe cases of human rights violation. These include the illegal eviction of slum-dwellers in Indore as well as the 2004 Malegaon riots. He is also the founder of Parivartan Shikshan Sanstha, that provides informal education in slums and Janata Ka Aaina, a newspaper for the last person.</p>

<p>It's almost impossible to imagine that this soft-spoken advocate with a fire in his belly could have risen out of a grimy slum in Mumbai. Born at Sion Hospital, he was brought up in the shanties at Sion Koliwada. His mother worked as a domestic help to make ends meet. His hutment, at the bottom of a hill, would have to be abandoned every monsoon due to frequent landslides and his family would have to seek shelter elsewhere. He was one of those whose homes were burnt down in the 1992-93 riots.</p>

<h3>Fight for Human Rights</h3>

<p>Shakil has actively campaigned for the implementation of the Sri Krishna Commission Report. In 2002 Shakil approached the Apex court seeking justice for several hundreds who suffered in perhaps one of the worst riots to have ever stuck Mumbai. Major success came in December last year when riot victim Farooqh Mapkar was acquitted of false charges leveled against him and the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI investigation against police officer Nikhil Kapse who indiscriminately fired at the Namaazis killing six people. Shakil took on the establishment and ensured justice is done.</p>

<p>“All this while Shakil fought with the establishment, its high time people like him enter politics. His role in seeking justice for the riot victims has been immense and he had fought a lone battle for over a decade now. I hope people understand his contribution and vote him whole heartedly,” said Mapkar.</p>

<p>Shakil along with other activists fought a long legal battle to ensure a FIR was registered against ex- commissioner of Mumbai R D Tyagi for the Suleman Usmaan Bakery firing case during the riots. Tyagi was accused of killing 11 people and injuring several people in police firing. “If every constituency has just ten men like Shakil, the problem of each constituency is taken care of. Shakil is not only an activist but a born leader. I have seen him grow and is amazing how this man relates with issues with immense understanding,” says Urdu writer-activist Sajid Rashid.</p>

<h3>Parivartan in Education</h3>

<p>Schooling although was a farfetched dream, Shakil managed to complete his graduation from Guru Nanak College. Simultaneously, Shakil also began tutoring kids in the Antop Hill slums which had no civic schools.</p>

<p>His efforts bore fruits in 1995 when he along with his friends founded Parivartan Shikshan Sanstha, an organisation that works towards providing an education to children in the Antop Hill slums. He also fought and won a seven-year-legal battle with the BMC to provide a municipal school for the Sangam Nagar slums at Antop Hill. Before the school was set up, children from the slum would have to walk 30 minutes to the nearest BMC School. Many were too poor to afford the private schools that had cropped up in the slum. “I had always known Shakil as a human right activist. But when I got to know about his school, I realized this man is indeed very serious in building the society as a better place to live in. Shakil comes from the most neglected strata yet it would be a privilege to have such people in mainstream politics,” said Documentary film maker Anand Patwardhan.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>Rtd. Bombay High court Judge Hosbet Suresh who has been an active face amongst city activists holds Shakil in high regards. Suresh strongly feels the political scenario has changed drastically in past years and no individual gets to elect his candidate in true sense. “Parties nominate their candidates and people in return vote for these candidates. People hardly get to choose their candidates. Shakil is a most upright candidate who is directly associated with people and knows things at ground reality,”
opines Suresh.</p>

<p>Unable to take the state violence and blatant human rights violation Shakil decided to pursue law. While pursuing law, Shakil got involved with Nirbhay Bano Andolan along with Nikhil Wagle, and took on the builder lobby in a number of instances. He also stood up against corrupt policemen who have exploited the poor. Shakil never deterred to call spade a spade. In a public meeting in Bandra where thousands had gathered to meet their star MP Sunil Dutt, Shakil openly criticized Dutt for have not done any bit to ensure justice for 1992-93 riot victims. Shakil was beaten up by the local goons.</p>

<p>Shakil was one of the pioneers who took up the cause of rehabilitation for project affected people. Shakil has on several instances fought legal fights with the strong and corrupt builder lobby of Mumbai.  “Shakil has been very active and has agitated against the builders and corporators in the city. He has been on the forefront in all the agitations since the beginning,” adds Medha Tai.</p>

<p>Shakil haven’t restricted his work towards one particular community or religion. He along with several activists started a movement to implement the findings of Justice S D Gundewar Commission report in Ramabai Ambedkar colony firing which killed ten persons and injured several in the firing. Shakil along with other activists approached the Bombay High court ensuring a case was registered against police sub-inspector Manohar Kadam who opened fired on the Dalits. Their  continues efforts and follow-ups in the case Kadam was recently convicted for life by a Session court.</p>

<p>“For many Shakil can be a complete non-conformist, but he stood by his principles. Even during the 12- year long struggle of the commission’s implementation, Shakil had stuck to his conscience and managed to keep all ill minds at the bay. He ended up making a lot of enemies too in the process; however, his fearlessness helped the case big way,” said High court lawyer Sangharaj Rupawate, another main force behind the movement. Rupawate feels Shakil’s entry in to politics will lead to political dialogue of which there is a dire need in main stream politics. “I don’t want to even gauge if Shakil will make a difference in the vote banks of other established parties. If Shakil even stands a chance to win. I am looking forward for certain meaningful political dialogue to begin,” added Rupawate.</p>

<p>Social activists who have seen Shakils work from close proximity feel he stands a fair chance to make his presence felt. “We have worked for decades together for the underprivileged sections. If like-minded people come together and support Shakil, he will surely manage to win. It’s a challenge but there is a definite need to step in to politics,” says Ramesh Haradkar, an activist who devoted himself for the cause of conservancy workers (safai karmachari) of Mumbai.</p>

<p>Shakil, has also tried his hands in journalism. After completing a post-graduate diploma in journalism, he worked for a year with Hamara Mahanagar. In 2010, he started Janata Ka Aaina, a hindi weekly dedicated to the stories that are ignored by mainstream media. Shakil is also a recipient of the prestigious Ashoka Fellowship</p>

<p>He has written two books--Police Banaam Janta Ki Adhikar and Hamara Ghar Hamara Adhikar--a book on the SRA scheme.</p>
